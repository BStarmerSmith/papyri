  ### User Input

This thread will be mostly about using the repo @[c:\Users\benlf\hobbyhelper\hobbyhelper-ops] - to manage my personal linux server I have hosted, I have tailscale on it for external use for now, but would like to be able to host both @[c:\Users\benlf\hobbyhelper\hobbyhelper-backend]  @[c:\Users\benlf\hobbyhelper\hobbyhelper-frontend] on it as well as other applications

I would like to think about how best to setup this server  coming from a devops perspective

### Planner Response

I'll help you set up your personal Linux server with a proper DevOps approach. Let's first explore what you already have in your hobbyhelper-ops repository to understand the current state.

*Listed directory [hobbyhelper-ops](file:///c:/Users/benlf/hobbyhelper/hobbyhelper-ops) *

### Planner Response

I see your hobbyhelper-ops repository is already set up with Terraform for infrastructure as code. Let's explore more details to understand what you currently have and plan the best DevOps approach for hosting your applications.

First, let's look at the README to get an overview:

*Viewed [README.md](file:///c:/Users/benlf/hobbyhelper/hobbyhelper-ops/README.md) *

### Planner Response

Let's examine the main Terraform files to understand your current infrastructure setup:

*Viewed [main.tf](file:///c:/Users/benlf/hobbyhelper/hobbyhelper-ops/main.tf) *

### Planner Response

Let's continue exploring your current setup to better understand how to approach hosting your applications. Let's first check your Docker setup in the backend repository:

*Viewed [docker-compose.yml](file:///c:/Users/benlf/hobbyhelper/hobbyhelper-backend/docker-compose.yml) *

### Planner Response

Now I have a better understanding of your setup. Let's explore the frontend configuration as well to get a complete picture:

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

Let's look at the root package.json for the frontend:

*Viewed [package.json](file:///c:/Users/benlf/hobbyhelper/hobbyhelper-frontend/package.json) *

### Planner Response

Now that I have a good understanding of your current setup, I'll recommend a comprehensive DevOps approach for hosting your applications on your personal Linux server. Based on what I've seen, you're already using modern practices with Terraform for infrastructure and Docker for containerization.

## DevOps Setup Recommendations

### 1. Container Orchestration

Since you already have Docker Compose for local development, I recommend using one of these approaches:

**Option A: Docker Compose in Production**
- Pros: Simpler setup, familiar from development, lower resource overhead
- Cons: Fewer built-in scaling/management features than Kubernetes

**Option B: Lightweight Kubernetes with K3s**
- Pros: Full container orchestration, scalability, robust management
- Cons: More complex, higher learning curve

For a personal server, Docker Compose is likely sufficient and simpler.

### 2. Reverse Proxy & SSL

Set up Traefik or Nginx as a reverse proxy to:
- Route traffic to the correct services
- Handle SSL certificates (via Let's Encrypt)
- Manage domain names for your applications

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

Since you have .github directory, implement GitHub Actions for:
1. Testing your code
2. Building container images
3. Pushing to your server
4. Automated deployment

### 4. Monitoring & Logging

- Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki for log aggregation
- Alertmanager for notifications if something goes wrong

### 5. Infrastructure as Code

Extend your existing Terraform setup to include:
- Server configuration (if not already there)
- Network security
- Storage management

### 6. Implementation Plan

Here's how I recommend proceeding:

1. **Basic Server Setup**
   - Configure server with Docker, Docker Compose
   - Set up Tailscale for secure remote access
   - Configure firewall (UFW/iptables)

2. **Container Registry**
   - Use Docker Hub or your existing AWS ECR

3. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow that:
     - Builds and tests code
     - Creates Docker images
     - Pushes to registry
     - Deploys to your server

4. **Application Configuration**
   - Externalize configuration in environment variables
   - Use secrets management for sensitive data
   - Configure frontend to point to backend API

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this plan or create some initial configuration files to get started?

### User Input

These are the specs of the machine GMKtec K6 Mini PC AMD R7-7840HS 8C/16T 16GB RAM 512GB

I know kubernetes so using it wont be a problem since I know I could use flux or argocd to manage it in a gitops way

But tell me do you think this machine would be good for a lightweight k8s system?

### Planner Response

Yes, the GMKtec K6 Mini PC with AMD R7-7840HS (8C/16T), 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage would be quite suitable for a lightweight Kubernetes setup, especially when using optimized distributions like K3s or MicroK8s.

### Analysis of your hardware:

1. **CPU (AMD R7-7840HS 8C/16T)**:
   - This is a powerful 8-core/16-thread processor based on Zen 4 architecture
   - More than sufficient for running the control plane and your containerized applications
   - Provides headroom for additional services like monitoring

2. **RAM (16GB)**:
   - Adequate for a lightweight K8s setup with your applications
   - HobbyHelper stack (frontend, backend, MongoDB) should run fine
   - You might want to monitor memory usage as you add more services
   - Consider an upgrade to 32GB if you plan to significantly expand your cluster

3. **Storage (512GB)**:
   - Sufficient for OS, Kubernetes components, and your applications
   - MongoDB will be your most storage-intensive application
   - Consider mounting an external drive if you need persistent storage for databases

### Recommendations for your K8s setup:

1. **Use K3s instead of full Kubernetes**:
   - Much lighter resource footprint
   - Single binary installation
   - Still provides core K8s functionality you need

2. **GitOps approach**:
   - Since you mentioned Flux or ArgoCD, I'd recommend Flux for this hardware
   - Slightly lighter resource requirements than ArgoCD
   - Works well with single-node clusters

3. **Storage considerations**:
   - Use local-path-provisioner (comes with K3s) for simple persistence
   - Configure your MongoDB to use a persistent volume

4. **Resource limits**:
   - Be sure to set appropriate resource limits on your deployments
   - Start conservative and adjust based on actual usage

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Use lightweight monitoring stack like Prometheus + Grafana
   - Consider using the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart configured for low resource usage

This hardware should comfortably run your HobbyHelper stack (frontend, backend, MongoDB) plus GitOps tools and basic monitoring in a Kubernetes environment with room to spare.

Would you like me to help you create initial Kubernetes manifests or a Flux configuration for this setup?

### User Input

Okay lets plan K3s then, lets plan the architecture and deployment 

### Planner Response

# K3s Architecture and Deployment Plan

## 1. Server Installation & Base Configuration

### K3s Installation
```bash
# Install K3s without Traefik (we'll use our own ingress)
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--disable=traefik" sh -

# Get kubeconfig for kubectl access
sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml > ~/.kube/config
chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
```

### System Preparation
- Create dedicated directories for persistent storage:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /data/mongodb /data/prometheus /data/grafana
  ```
- Configure server for optimal container performance:
  ```bash
  # Set system limits for container runtime
  cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-kubernetes.conf
  vm.swappiness=10
  fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
  EOF
  sudo sysctl --system
  ```

### Ingress Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hobbyhelper
  namespace: hobbyhelper
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - hobby.example.com
    secretName: hobbyhelper-tls
  rules:
  - host: hobby.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: hobbyhelper-backend
            port:
              number: 3000

            port:
              number: 80
```

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline

Use GitHub Actions to:
1. Build Docker images on push to main branch
2. Push images to your container registry
3. Update the image tags in your GitOps repository
4. Let Flux handle the deployment

## 8. Installation Process

1. **Set up base K3s server**
2. **Install Flux CLI and bootstrap**:
   ```bash
   flux bootstrap github \
     --owner=BStarmerSmith \
     --repository=hobbyhelper-ops \
     --path=clusters/homeserver \
     --personal
   ```
3. **Add your container registry credentials**
4. **Create initial manifests and push**
5. **Flux will deploy infrastructure components first, then applications**

## 9. Integration with Tailscale

Since you're already using Tailscale:
- Configure the Tailscale subnet router to expose your K3s services
- Consider setting up MagicDNS for easy access to your services

## 10. Resource Optimization

Since this is a single-node cluster on limited hardware:
- Set appropriate resource limits on all deployments
- Enable pod disruption budgets for critical components
- Configure horizontal pod autoscaling for variable loads

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this plan or create some starter manifests for your GitOps repository?

### User Input

One second why wont we use traffik?

### Planner Response

You're absolutely right to ask about Traefik! That's a very good point.

Traefik is an excellent choice for K3s and has several advantages:

1. **Native K3s Integration**: K3s actually includes Traefik by default as its ingress controller (which is why I mentioned disabling it in my installation command, since I was planning to use Nginx)

2. **Auto-Configuration**: Traefik can automatically discover services and configure routes based on labels, which makes configuration more declarative and distributed

3. **Modern Architecture**: It's designed for cloud-native and microservices environments from the ground up

4. **Dashboard**: Comes with a built-in dashboard for visualization and monitoring

5. **Multi-Protocol Support**: Beyond HTTP, it supports TCP, UDP, and gRPC

Let's revise the plan to use Traefik instead:

### Modified K3s Installation

```bash
# Install K3s with the default Traefik
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

# Get kubeconfig for kubectl access
sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml > ~/.kube/config
chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
```

### Traefik IngressRoute (replacing the Nginx Ingress)

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: hobbyhelper
  namespace: hobbyhelper
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`hobby.example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/api`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: hobbyhelper-backend
          port: 3000
    - match: Host(`hobby.example.com`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: hobbyhelper-frontend
          port: 80
  tls:
    secretName: hobbyhelper-tls
```

### Middleware for TLS Redirect

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: redirect-to-https
  namespace: hobbyhelper
spec:
  redirectScheme:
    scheme: https
    permanent: true
```

### Certificate Management with Traefik and cert-manager

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    email: your-email@example.com
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: traefik
```

Using Traefik is indeed a better choice for K3s since:

1. It's already integrated with K3s, saving resources
2. It provides more modern features like automatic service discovery
3. It has a simpler configuration model with IngressRoute CRDs
4. It's highly optimized for performance in edge/IoT scenarios, which fits your hardware profile

The rest of the architecture would remain largely the same, with the advantage that Traefik provides a unified entry point for all your services, allowing for features like canary deployments, circuit breakers, and rate limiting through simple configuration.

Would you prefer to continue with the Traefik-based approach instead of Nginx?
